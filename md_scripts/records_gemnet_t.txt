this is using my trained gemnet-t model on the entire dataset, mean -140
so energy is still not being conserved (as expected from other results, this was just double checking)
molecule: C6H6
init_idx: 8539

GEMNET-T CHECKPOINT
traj[0] potential energy: -6324.0199353045655
traj[-1] potential energy: -6323.820915895632
energy is off by 199.01940893305436 meV
